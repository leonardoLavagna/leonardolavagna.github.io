I'm a mathematician specialized in Data Science currently pursuing a PhD in Quantum Computing at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home) at the [Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications (DIET)](https://web.uniroma1.it/dip_diet/en) in the [Neural Network Systems & Applications Laboratory (NESYA)](https://sites.google.com/view/nesya) (official academic webpage available [here](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/LEONARDO-LAVAGNA_nP1650170_IT.aspx)). Before starting my journey in quantum computing I've worked as an IT consultant and as a data scientist. I am passionate about participating in innovative projects that contribute to the improvement of society and the environment. 

## About
This is my personal website where I share my research and other work-related activities. This website is associated to technical blog [lavagnaleo.wordpress.com](https://lavagnaleo.wordpress.com/) and to the italian non-technical blog [geometrino.wordpress.com](https://geometrino.wordpress.com/).


## Contacts
You can reach me at **leonardo.lavagna@uniroma1.it** or in person (please take an appointment via e-mail first!) in [via Eudossiana 18 Building B first floor](https://diet.web.uniroma1.it/en/how-reach-us) room 111.


## Collaborations
I like to carry out some side projects in collaboration with someone outside my workplace or outside my close academic network. The main idea is to connect with interesting people in the field of data science, have fun, and improve our soft and hard skills. Typically I try to work on one or two projects each year with some data enthusiast like me. Most of this projects are either reviews on specific topics, challenges (prized and unprized), exchange of opinions and collaborative coding. Sometimes I can propose collaborations on paid specialized consultancies. This year I have the following project in mind, if you are interested contact me.
- [Blaise Pascal Quantum Challenge](https://www.agorize.com/en/challenges/blaisepascalquantumchallenge2025?lang=en). Prized contest issued by [Pasqal](https://www.pasqal.com/) 💵 🧑🏻‍💻 👎🏻 🚫.
- Development of a Machine Learning Tool for a CMO 💼 💵 🧑🏻‍💻.

Some collaborations are simple coding tasks, other are paied contests or research topics, in particular: 
        💼 Require a formal contract | 💵 Is paid | 👍🏻 Is done | 👎🏻 Is not done | 🚫 Is closed | 🔎 Is research | 🧑🏻‍💻 Is coding 

Further details about this kind of collaborative projects are available [on my GitHub page](https://github.com/leonardoLavagna/Collaborations).
