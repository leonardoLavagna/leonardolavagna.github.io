I'm a mathematician specialized in Data Science currently pursuing a PhD in Quantum Computing at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home) at the [Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications (DIET)](https://web.uniroma1.it/dip_diet/en) in the [Neural Network Systems & Applications Laboratory (NESYA)](https://sites.google.com/view/nesya) (official academic webpage available [here](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/LEONARDO-LAVAGNA_nP1650170_IT.aspx)). Before starting my journey in quantum computing I've worked as an IT consultant and as a data scientist. I am passionate about participating in innovative projects that contribute to the improvement of society and the environment.
