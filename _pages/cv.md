A one-page italian version of my CV is available [here](../assets/files/cv_ita.pdf) (una pagina riassuntiva del mio CV in italiano Ã¨ disponibile [qui](../assets/files/cv_ita.pdf)).

## Personal Information
My name is [Leonardo](https://pronouncenames.com/search?name=leonardo) and my surname is [Lavagna](https://pronouncenames.com/pronounce/lavagna). I was born in [Cagliari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cagliari) and I live in [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome). I'm a matematician specialized in data science, with working experience in the fields of bioinformatics, statistics, machine learning and affine areas. Currently I'm pursuing a PhD in quantum computing at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home) in the [NESYA](https://sites.google.com/view/nesya?authuser=0) multidisciplinary lab in the [Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications (DIET)](https://web.uniroma1.it/dip_diet/en).

## Working Experience
I have worked as Data Analyst and Researcher in consulting firms active in biotechnologies, chemistry and related areas. I've some experience as a developer (also with cloud technologies) and occasionally I've worked as a consultant in the field of cybersecurity. More recently, I co-founded a start-up with my friend and colleague, [Giorgio](https://research.uniroma1.it/researcher/8746df53b026e680e84f1858fd0e24ede56010ff1aff812a0ea415ea), specializing in the development of innovative IT solutions. We focus on automation, digitization, and process optimization using technologies such as AI and cloud computing. While we primarily serve the pharmaceutical sector, we also work across various industries, offering custom software, data analysis, IT consulting, and IoT solutions.

## Foreign Languages
My motherlanguage is Italian, I am fluent in English, and I have a basic knowledge of German. Currently I'm studying Chinese and trying to remember the Franch I've learnt in school. 
  * ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ **Cambridge English: Proficiency (level C2)**
  * ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **B1 Deutch PrÃ¼fung**

## Information Technologies
I have a working knowledge of Python, R, C, MATLAB, and affine languages. Moreover, Iâ€™m familiar with working in macOS, Unix, and Linux environments, as well as with development tools such as Anaconda and Visual Studio Code. I have both practical and research experience in machine learning applications (from anomaly detection to recommendation systems) and quantum computing. Iâ€™ve also worked with databases, automation (Arduino, Raspberry Pi), game and app development, and a touch of web development. My experience with the AWS cloud platform is limited but goode enough to deploy small-sized projects. I also have a good understanding of cryptography and blockchain technologies, as well as protocols such as TCP/IP and Ethernet. More importantly, every time I open Office, I feel like Iâ€™m using a tool designed by someone who really doesnâ€™t like me. If you really want to test my patience, just send me Word documents or Excel spreadsheets...
  * **Selection of Programming Lenguages** C, C++, Python, MatLab, Java, R
  * **Selection of operating systems** Mac Os X, Unix, Linux
  * **Selection of Developing environments and platforms** Anaconda, Git, Github, Heroku, Streamlit, Wordpress
  * **Cloud platforms** AWS
  * **Databases** SQL with MySQL, no-SQL with MongoDB
  * **Other** Cryptography, penetration testing and network analysis, LANs, simple electronical circuits, basic computer architectures, basic web design skills (HTML, CSS).

## Other
I've studied piano and composition at [Santa Cecilia conservatory of Rome](https://conservatoriosantacecilia.it/). I've also playied tennis at a semi-professional level, but then I had to choose between my music passion, studying mathematics, and sports... music & math won, and for some time I had the "pleasure" of being piano accompanist to some singers... Nonetheless I became a [certified FIT tennis teacher](https://www.fitp.it/Istituto-di-formazione/Insegnanti/I-livelli-di-qualifica) and sports director. I'm also a certified Rescue Padi Diver, and I enjoy the occasional Dive. More importantly, I like the occasional sail. 

During the years I have done miscellaneous jobs related to these passions of mine: from sailing teacher at the very nice and original [Mal di Mare sailing school](https://maldimare.eu/wp/), to tennis teacher with the ASD D'Innocenzo Tennis Team in Rome. I like excursionism, if bossible with my bike. I'm a good chess player, where good means that I can beat most of my friends, but I loose to $\sim 1800$ Elo players online. Ah, I also have a passion for "ugly" postcards, and I collect them.
