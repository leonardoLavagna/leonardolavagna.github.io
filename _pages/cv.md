## Other Informations
I've studied piano and composition at [Santa Cecilia conservatory of Rome](https://conservatoriosantacecilia.it/). I've also playied tennis at a semi-professional level, but then I had to choose between my music passion, studying mathematics, and sports... music & math won, and fore some time I had the "pleasure" of being piano accompanist to some singers... Nonetheless I became a [certified FIT tennis teacher](https://www.fitp.it/Istituto-di-formazione/Insegnanti/I-livelli-di-qualifica) and sports director. I'm also a certified Rescue Padi Diver, and I enjoy the occasional Dive. More importantly, I like the occasional sail. 

During the years I have done miscellaneous jobs related to these passions of mine: from sailing teacher at the very nice and original [Mal di Mare sailing school](https://maldimare.eu/wp/), to tennis teacher with the ASD D'Innocenzo Tennis Team in Rome. I like excursionism, if bossible with my bike. I'm a good chess player, where good means that I can beat most of my friends, but I loose to $\sim 1800$ Elo players online. Ah, I also have a passion for "ugly" postcards, and I collect them.
