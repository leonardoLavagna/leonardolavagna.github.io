Presentation at the [2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks](https://2025.ijcnn.org/) about “Novel quantum approaches to Hyperdimensional computing for Neural Networks”. The notes for the presentation are available [here](/assets/files/ijcnn2025-2.pdf) and [here](https://lavagnaleo.wordpress.com/2025/04/26/merging-hyperdimensional-computing-and-quantum-computing/) is a related blog post. In [this repository](https://github.com/leonardoLavagna/qhdc) you find all the implementations related to the project.
