title: "A topical review on time-independent perturbation theory in one-dimensional quantum systems"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-10-3-PERTURB1
excerpt: 'This review presents time-independent perturbative methods for solving the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation, highlighting representative cases that reveal key aspects of the theory. The focus is on their relevance to quantum computing applications, particularly in systems with finite-dimensional state spaces. Blog post [here](https://lavagnaleo.wordpress.com/2025/09/05/perturbation-theory-in-the-qubit-model/) and code [here](https://github.com/leonardoLavagna/perturbative_methods).

This review presents time-independent perturbative methods for solving the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation, highlighting representative cases that reveal key aspects of the theory. The focus is on their relevance to quantum computing applications, particularly in systems with finite-dimensional state spaces.
