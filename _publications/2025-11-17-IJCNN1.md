In this work, we introduce new quantum machine learning models that combine both quantum and hyperdimensional computing. 
We focus our effort on two novel architectures that are first theoretically demonstrated, and then applied for testing to 
prototypical machine learning tasks, namely for pattern completion, classification, and clustering. We obtained accurate 
and promising results that prove, for the first time, the synergies between two of the most innovative computational approaches 
such as quantum computing and hyperdimensional computing.
