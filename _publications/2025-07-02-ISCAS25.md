This paper explores the integration of quantum tools into classical cryptographic systems to assess their impact on the feasibility-efficiency trade-off in the context of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum technology. By focusing on the hybridization of classical low-level primitives and high level cryptographic tools, the study investigates the effect of quantum contributions on encryption schemes corresponding to trapdoor permutations, revealing significant insights into the intersection of cryptography, quantum computing, and Boolean circuit theory.
