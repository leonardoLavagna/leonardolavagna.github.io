This work was the natural development of my master thesis on quantum optimization, where we investigated parameter fixing strategies for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its Multi-Angle extension. In particular, in this work we proposed a novel variant of the QAOA, called Layerwise Multi-Angle QAOA (LMA-QAOA). Since the known parameter fixing strategy imposes constraints on QAOA to enhance tractability at the cost of some expressive power, the proposed layerwise approach integrates it with the existing Multi-Angle QAOA technique, which is characterized in turn by heightened expressiveness through an increased number of parameters, but with increased optimization challenges. Thus, the proposed LMA-QAOA combines the strengths of one variant with the limitations of the other, striking a balance in algorithmic design.
