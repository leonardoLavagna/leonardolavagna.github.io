[@NESYA](https://sites.google.com/view/nesya), in collaboration with the [Department of Chemistry and Technologies of Drugs](https://dctf.web.uniroma1.it/en) 
and with [BSP Pharmaceuticals](https://www.bsppharmaceuticals.com/), we have published an [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517325011998)
about the simulation capabilities of a machine learning [mixture of experts model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_of_experts) in the production of [liposomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome).
Code available [here](https://github.com/leonardoLavagna/Intelligent-Control-of-Microfluidic-Systems), with a user-friendly application [here](https://smart-microfluidics.streamlit.app/).
