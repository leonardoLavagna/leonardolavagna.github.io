I'm going to present at [IJCNN 2025](https://2025.ijcnn.org/) a couple of recent results about the intersections of [quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) and [hyperdimensional computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperdimensional_computing), and a collaboration on the application of [QAOA-type methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_optimization_algorithms) to [anomaly detection problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection) in univariate [time-series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series). This year I'm lucky that the conference will be held in [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome), thanks to all the organizers for the amazing work they are doing. If you happen to be around let me know!
