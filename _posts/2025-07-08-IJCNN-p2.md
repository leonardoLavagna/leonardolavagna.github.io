As discussed in [this previous post](https://leonardolavagna.github.io/posts/2025/5/IJCNN25/), the [2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)](https://2025.ijcnn.org/) took place in Rome and our group [@NESYA](https://sites.google.com/view/nesya-it/home) organized a workshop and a special session:
- Quantum Computing and Quantum Neural Networks â€“ QCNN: a very nice, open and frank workshop about the state of the art and possible directions of quantum computing, with international speakers from [Fermilab](https://www.fnal.gov/), [ESA](https://www.esa.int/), [CERN](https://home.cern/) and prestigious universities across the world. The detailed program of the workshop can befound [here](../assets/files/ijcnn2025-1.pdf). 
- Hyperdimensional Computing and Vector Symbolic Architectures for Neural Networks and Artificial Intelligence: a very interesting special session to broaden the view about promising alternatives to standard machine learniong architectures, with in-depth talks about some difficult aspects of vector symbolic computations and new ideas to push forward the research in this niche. 

In this context I was lead author of a paper presented at the special session on Hyperdimensional computing, with intersections with the quantum computing workshop. In [this post] you can find a discursive summary of the talk, and [here](../assets/files/ijcnn2025-2.pdf) you can find the associated slides. If you are curious we have made also the code available in [this repository](https://github.com/leonardoLavagna/qhdc). I was also a co-author of a paper presented our new PhD student Marco Casalbore about an Hybrid Quantum-Classical Framework for Anomaly Detection in Time Series with QUBO
formulation and QAOA. I don't have his slides, but [here](https://github.com/NesyaLab/Quantum_Anomaly_Detection) you can find the project's code.
