Acoording to tradition, also this year we are hosting the [Open DIET](https://diet.web.uniroma1.it/en/node/6883) event where highschool students can join for one day the research teams in our Department in innovative projects and see with their own eyes cutting edge technologies and curren trends in modern electronics, artificial intelligence and quantum computing. This year I will propose a (hopefully fun) project where a student can simulate Classical and Quantum Walks with an Arduino-Based LED System. All the details are in [this repository](https://github.com/leonardoLavagna/open_diet_2025). If you happen to be in Rome in that period, let me know!
