[@NESYA](https://github.com/NesyaLab) we have have published an [article](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1402-4896/ae0a8f) 
that contextualizes [perturbative methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory) in the [quantum circuit model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit).
Check the [associated blog post](https://lavagnaleo.wordpress.com/2025/09/05/perturbation-theory-in-the-qubit-model/) or the [associated materials](https://leonardolavagna.github.io/publication/2025-10-3-PERTURB1) to know more about this article.
