I have just published a simplified version of the dataset we recently published on Zenodo (see [here](https://leonardolavagna.github.io/posts/2025/5/SmartMicrofluidicsDataset/)), also on Kaggle.
The simplified version is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leolavagna/ml-ready-clinically-inspired-liposome-data).
