[@NESYA](https://github.com/NesyaLab) we have have published an [article]([https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1402-4896/ae0a8f](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/396483291_Small_graph_perturbations_QAOA_and_the_MaxCut_problem)) 
that analyze the effect of graph perturbations on the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Check the [associated materials](https://leonardolavagna.github.io/publication/2025-10-17-AVS1) to know more about this article.
