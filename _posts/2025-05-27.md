I've presented our work at the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems and had very interesting 
discussions about post-quantum cryptography. Thanks to the orgaizers for the amazing work. You can chek my slides 
[here](../assets/files/iscas2025.pdf) and [here](https://lavagnaleo.wordpress.com/2025/02/28/hellmans-construction-and-quantum-cryptography/)
you can find a blog post that summarizes the motivation and context of our results. As soon as the proceedings of the conference will
be published I will also share more details about our findings.
