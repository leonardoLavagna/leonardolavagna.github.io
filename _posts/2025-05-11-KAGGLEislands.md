I have just published a simple educational project that should help the novice to get started with the Google Earth Engine API. The main steps of this project are summarized in the [associated Github repository](https://github.com/leonardoLavagna/cluster_islands_renewable_energy). As a byproduct of the project I have created a new dataset on Kaggle, check it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leolavagna/islands)! This dataset provides geographic and environmental data on different islands from around the world, focusing on their potential for renewable energy generation. It includes information on solar irradiance, wind speeds, and other characteristics useful for sustainability studies and geographic analysis. Since there are not so many public cleaned dataset of this kind I hope it will be usefull.
