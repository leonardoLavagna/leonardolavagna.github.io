[@NESYA](https://github.com/NesyaLab) we have have published an [article](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2849278) about about an hybrid quantum-classical Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) used to infer information about multidimensional time series. Check the [associated blog post](https://lavagnaleo.wordpress.com/2024/11/25/evolving-hybrid-quantum-classical-gru-architectures-for-multivariate-time-series/) to know more about this article.
